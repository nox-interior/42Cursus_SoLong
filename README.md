# 42Cursus_SoLong
42 common core project "So Long", a mini 2D game

MLX42 obtained from https://github.com/42-Fundacion-Telefonica/MLX42

42CODAM original library and documentation: https://github.com/codam-coding-college/MLX42

This program runs on Linux, just download the repository and write ```make``` on the terminal. If some library is missing, check the instructions provided in the 42CODAM link above.

Use ```./so_long maps/<map_you_want_to_use>```

It's a small silly game, but I've learned A LOT about error handling, data parsing, and, of course, MLX42 graphic library.

Go check it!
